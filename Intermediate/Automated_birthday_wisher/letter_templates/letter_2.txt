Hey [NAME],
On your birthday, I hope you pause to see just how far you’ve come. 🌱 You've grown, loved, struggled, laughed — and you’re still standing. Stronger 💪. Smarter 🧠. Kinder 💗.

This year, I hope you chase your dreams without fear 🦋 and love without limits 💕. Remember, you are more than enough — exactly as you are.

Celebrate boldly today — you deserve every moment of joy 🥳.

With all my heart,
Anonymous❤️
