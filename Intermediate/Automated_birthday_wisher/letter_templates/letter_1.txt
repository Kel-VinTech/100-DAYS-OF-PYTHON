Happy Birthday! 🎂💫 Today, I just want to remind you how much you matter — not just to me, but to everyone lucky enough to know you. You're someone who spreads light 🌟, kindness 💛, and strength 💪 wherever you go.

May this year surprise you with love that feels like home 🏡, opportunities that excite your soul ✨, and peace that lasts. You deserve every bit of happiness this world has to offer.
